# Initiative for Open Source Dock (osdock.net) Project

## Motivation

There is a long history for open source movement since 1980s. (I know RMS has his option about free software, I'll talk it later)
Nowdays, open source has played the main role in many IT fields.
And further more, open source has turned to be a spirit of democracy and freedom for science, technologies and engineering. 
But open source is remaining in small circles.
Many people get benefit from open source, but most of them have no idea to get involved in open source.
The reality is people are hard to know where or how to contribute their passion to open source. 
On the other side, open source communities are expecting for more contributors and they don't know where and how to find, either. 
*We need an information center to fill the gap*
*We need a community to serve open source communities*

## Objective

- Help people to get involved in open source commnunities easily if they are interested to do
- Help open source communities to get more contributors quickly if they are worth to do

## Slogan

**A community for contributers to communities**

## The meaning of osdock 
osdock means **Open Source Dock**.
Real dock is like

OSX-style dock is like

**Dock** is a launching list or an information portal to open source things

**Open Source** here is not only mean open source software or open source code.

I notice that many people use FOSS (free and open source software) to show respect to RMS opinions.
I am really admire Richard Stallman and his FSF.
But I think it is no need to add free in front of open-source for reasons as
- open-source here is brief and general speaking, not only represents open source software defined by OSI.
- open-source now is also changing to be a noun and adjective to describe everything that follow the philosophy behind free and open source software.
- open-source is just a tag for easy identification and speaking. i.e. open-source car vs. free car or free-software car, which one will make you understand quickly? Otherwise, free and open source car is too long to speak and write.  

## Design rules for osdock.net

- community driven, open-source front-end, back-end and database as much as possible (i.e. for security sake, user's password will not open)
- multiple languages support
- multiple regions support
- OAuth login with open-source communities as many as possible
